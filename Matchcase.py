# Matchcase is like the switch statement in python but we cant use te break statement in it  bcz it runs only that case which it matches

x=int(input("Enter the value of x:"))
match x:
  case 0 if x%2==0:
    print("x is Even")
  case 1 if x%2!=0:
    print(" Numbers is odd")
  case _:
    print("Number is special")
   # Topic12
for i in range(10):
  print(i)
# Print table of choice
num=int(input("Enter the number :"))
for i in range(1,11):
print("The table of your selected number is:"              {num}*{i}={num*i}")
num = int(input("Enter the number :"))
for i in range(1, 11):
  print(f"The table of your selected number is: {num} * {i} = {num * i}")
#   # Now Oh comeon you know very well about while loop
# just 1 min
